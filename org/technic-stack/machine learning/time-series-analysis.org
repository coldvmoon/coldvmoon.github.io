#+TITLE: Anomaly Detection -- Time Series Analysis
* General Approach to Time Series Modeling  
* Algorithms 
** Seasonal Data
Seasonal time series can always decompose to three patterns

1. Trend :: sdfsf
2. sdfs :: sdfsf
The additive model use is: 
$$\mathbf{Y}_t=\mathbf{T}_t+\mathbf{S}_i+\mathbf{Y}_t$$
The multiplicative model used is:
$$\mathbf{Y}_t=\mathbf{T}_t*\mathbf{S}_i*\mathbf{Y}_t$$
