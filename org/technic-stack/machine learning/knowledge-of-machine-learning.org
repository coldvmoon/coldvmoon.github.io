** Machine learning algorithms
*** Supervised learning
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our
correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship
between the input and the output.
**** classification 
continuous value 
**** regression
discrete value
**** hypothesis function
**** cost function
*** Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what
our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't
necessarily know the effect of the variables.

*** Reinforcement learning
*** recommender systems
** Linear regression
*** Cost Function
*** Gradient Descent Intuintion
*** Feature Scaling 
** Optimization algorithm 
*** Gradient Descent
*** Conjugate gradient
*** BFGS
*** L-BFGS
** OverFitting
*** Reduce the number of features
**** Manually select which feature to keep 
**** use a model selection algorithm 
*** Regularization 
**** Keep all the feature,but reduce the magnitude of parameter 
**** Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly userful features.
